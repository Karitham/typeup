# Typeup

This is a WIP parser for the Typeup markup language.

The spec is not entirely defined yet, so everything is subject to change.

The goal is to build an AST from the document, and then being able to convert it to HTML or GitHub Flavored Markdown easily.

You can find the current typeup goals [here](https://git.sr.ht/~skuzzymiglet/typeup)

Any help given is appreciated, I'm fairly new to this and completely open to any suggestion, idea or PR.
